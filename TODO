DONE- README
DONE- more tests
DONE- Fix TEST001 - if dose doesn't divide exactly into prescription then last day should have a reduced dose
DONE- Fix TEST013 - two close Rx - large dose / first known, second unknown / assume following previous instruction, rather than what was necessary to exhaust previous Rx
DONE- Fix TEST046 - incorrect assignment for "OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE 10mg/mL concentrate sugar free liquid" as most rubrics are "Oxycodone 5mg/5ml oral solution sugar free"
DONE- more checks??
